# Youtube Comment Sentiment Analysis

## **Requirement Analysis**

Requirement analysis involves defining the needs, goals, and expectations of the product or application. This step includes engaging with stakeholders and end-users to gather their inputs, document requirements, and resolve any conflicts or ambiguities to ensure alignment.

---

## **Feasibility Check**

This step assesses whether implementing YouTube Comment Sentiment Analysis is practical and achievable. It includes evaluating the technical, financial, and time-related aspects to determine if the project can be executed successfully.

---

## **Set Timeline Phase by Phase**

To ensure an organized approach, a timeline is established for each phase of the project. For instance, conducting the feasibility study might take 1–2 weeks, while data collection or preprocessing phases could each have their own deadlines. Defining these timelines keeps the project on track.

---

## **Design Data Collection Methodology**

If the feasibility check is successful, the next step is to determine how to collect data for the project. For YouTube Comment Sentiment Analysis, this might involve using API calls or libraries to gather comments from specific YouTube videos. The method should align with project goals and be scalable.

---

## **Data Cleaning/Transformation**

This step focuses on cleaning and transforming raw data to make it suitable for analysis. It involves removing unnecessary or irrelevant information, handling missing values, and ensuring the data is in a consistent and usable format for NLP models.

---

## **Data Processing**

Once the data is cleaned, preprocessing is performed to prepare it for model input. Common preprocessing steps include:

- Removing special characters (e.g., `@`, `#`, `!`).
- Eliminating numbers if they are not relevant to the task.
- Normalizing whitespace (e.g., removing extra spaces or tabs).
- Converting text to lowercase for uniformity.
- Removing HTML tags, URLs, or other extraneous elements if necessary.

---

## **Model Development**

In this phase, the NLP model is designed, trained, and fine-tuned to solve the specific task, such as sentiment analysis. This involves selecting the appropriate algorithm (e.g., traditional ML models or advanced models like BERT), defining the architecture, and optimizing hyperparameters.

---

## **Model Evaluation**

The trained model is evaluated using a test dataset to measure its performance against key metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score. Additionally, testing the model with random inputs ensures it performs consistently across various scenarios.

---

## **Model Deployment and Monitoring**

After successful evaluation, the model is deployed into a production environment. Continuous monitoring is essential to track its performance over time, address potential issues, and implement updates or fine-tuning based on changing requirements or data trends.

- Identify relevant pages, posts, or groups that align with the project goals.  Set up filters to collect relevant data, such as language and date range.

---

## **5. Data Cleaning/Transformation**

Raw Facebook comments usually contain a lot of noise; hence, preprocessing may involve the following steps:  
 Removal of irrelevant symbols-emojis or punctuation- depending on the context.

- Detection and correction of spellings or abbreviations peculiar to social media sites.
- Preprocessing multilingual text when the dataset covers more than one language.

---

## **6. Data Preprocessing**

The cleaned data then goes for preprocessing:

- **Tokenization**: Text is broken down into words or terms/ phrases.
- **Stemming/Lemmatization**: Words are brought to their base form.
- **Vectorization**: The process of converting text into numerical formats using methods such as Bag of Words, TF-IDF, or word embeddings.

---

## **7. Model Development**

This is where the actual development of the sentiment analysis model is done:

- **Algorithm Selection**: Depending on dataset size and complexity, the choice could be:
- Traditional ML: Naïve Bayes, Logistic Regression.
- Deep Learning: RNNs, Transformers such as BERT, RoBERTa.
- **Hyperparameter Optimization**: Fine-tuning the parameters for the best performance.
- **Training**: Running the models on the preprocessed dataset.

---

## **8. Model Evaluation**

The performance of the model will be evaluated by the following metrics:

- **Accuracy**: The percentage of predictions that are correct.
- **Precision and Recall**: Measures of the model's correctness and completeness.
- **F1-Score**: Harmonic mean of precision and recall.
- **Confusion Matrix**: Visualizing true positives, false positives, etc.

---

## **9. Model Deployment & Monitoring**

Validating the model then deploying it on appropriate tools will be through Flask APIs or cloud services. Monitoring post-deployment shall consist of:
i. **Performance Metric Tracking**: The model should perform on par with real-world data.
ii. **Drift Handling**: Regular retraining of the model to adapt to evolving sentiment trends.
iii. **Feedback Loop**: The system should integrate feedback for improvement.
